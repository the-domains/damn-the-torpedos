Coffee's Third Wave is here, and you are asking yourself, what the hell does that even mean.  Well, it comes down to quality and deliciousness, no over roasted sickly sweet whipped cream concoctions here.  Damn the Torpedos Coffee is about the bean, the roast and the aspects of coffee that you may not normally think about.  We'll take care of the intricate details, but we make it easy for you to learn the qualities that fit your palate and why a cup of coffee on it's own will make you appreciate the marriage of the bean and H2O.
