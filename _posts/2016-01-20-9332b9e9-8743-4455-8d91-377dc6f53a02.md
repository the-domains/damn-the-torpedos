Coffee, no we are not talking about the watered down, brown liquid that is sought out for the caffeine and comes from a pod or a machine or any other contrived convenience.  We are talking about the delicious, exquisite, drink that is layered in aromas and tastes, the kind that most of us never knew.  We drank the java, the mud, the cup of joe and just didn't know the likes of the Third Wave of Coffee, we didn't understand the specialty coffee, and we surely didn't know there was such a thing as varietals of coffee.  But oh yes, Friendo, we are Damn The Torpedos Coffee aim to get you past all the terroir, altitude, processing, varietals and all other overwhelming aspects, and give you a world class cup of coffee.  Some might call it a "Damn Fine Cup of Coffee", no offense Agent Cooper.  Come by and shoot the breeze, we will pour you the goods, and let you know as much or as little about that warm (or cold if you go for that kind of thing) cup of coffee that you are cradling in your hot little hands.  Damn The Torpedos Coffee, there is something better.
